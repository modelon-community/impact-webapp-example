# ðŸš€ Welcome to an Impact Webapp Example!

This example illustrates how a web app could be implemented and developped for Modelon Impact.

## Develop

You can run a development server to test your app using:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This works both when developing locally and developing on an impact server.

## Build

```sh
npm run build
```

## Install

> **_NOTE:_** Only possible when the project is checked out as a project on an impact server.

This will copy/replace the built code into ~/impact/customizations
```sh
./install.sh
```

## Info

This project has been created using **webpack-cli**.
