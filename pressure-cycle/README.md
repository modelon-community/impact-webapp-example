# ðŸš€ Welcome to an Impact Webapp Example!

This example illustrates how a web app could be implemented and developed for Modelon Impact.

## Develop

You can run a development server to test your app using:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This works both when developing locally and developing on an impact server.

## Build

```sh
npm run build
```

## Install

> **_NOTE:_** Only possible when the project is checked out as a project on an impact server.

```sh
npm run build
```

This will build the app into the designated *CUSTOM_WEB_APPS* folder for the project. After this is run, the app will be available from any workspace that has added this project.

## Info

This project has been created using **webpack-cli**.
