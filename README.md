# Modelon Impact Webapp Example

This is an example of how to work with the Modelon Impact Client for Javascript.

The custom web app example is located in the `pressure-cycle` directory, and presents a good baseline
on how to develop custom web apps. See the [README](./pressure-cycle/README.md) for details and comments on the setup.

The `Example` modelica package contains the model utilized by the `pressure-cycle` example app.
