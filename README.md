# Modelon Impact Webapp Example

This is an example [Modelon Impact project](https://help.modelon.com/latest/reference/workspace/#projects) of how to work with the Modelon Impact Client for Javascript.

The custom web app example is located in the `pressure-cycle` directory, and presents a good baseline
on how to develop custom web apps. 

The `Example` modelica package contains the model utilized by the `pressure-cycle` example app.

## Install

Load this repo as a project using the [project explorer](https://help.modelon.com/latest/articles/ao_project_explorer/) in Modelon Impact. 

In order to use and load the app in a workspace, the app needs to be built. Run the following from the terminal in the vscode plugin:

1. `cd  pressure-cycle`
2. `make build`

Now the app should be accessible from the apps menu in a workspace that has the project loaded.

## Develop

See the [README](./pressure-cycle/README.md) for details and comments on the setup.
